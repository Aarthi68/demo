Possible Recovery Options (Outside Git)
1️⃣ Check Your Recycle Bin (Windows) / Trash (Mac/Linux)

If you deleted the file from File Explorer/Finder, it might still be there.

2️⃣ Check Backup or Cloud Sync (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.)

If you had cloud sync enabled, try restoring an earlier version.

3️⃣ Use Data Recovery Software

Tools like Recuva (Windows) or TestDisk (Mac/Linux) might recover deleted files.

4️⃣ Check Your IDE’s Local History (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.)

Some code editors save temporary backups.
